                <li><span class="font-bold">Japan Rail Pass:</span> A 7-day Japan Rail Pass is recommended for this itinerary. It will cover your travel between Tokyo and Kyoto, as well as the day trip to Nara.</li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Packing:</span> Pack comfortable walking shoes, as you'll be doing a lot of exploring on foot. Also, pack layers of clothing, as the weather in April can be unpredictable.</li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Cash:</span> While credit cards are widely accepted in major cities, it's always a good idea to have some cash on hand for smaller shops and restaurants.</li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Connectivity:</span> Consider renting a pocket Wi-Fi device or purchasing a Japanese SIM card to stay connected during your trip.</li>
