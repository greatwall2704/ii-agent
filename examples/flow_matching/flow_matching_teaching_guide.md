### Slide 4: From Normalizing Flows to CNFs
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Key Points**:
- This is foundational - ensure students understand the progression
- Emphasize the move from discrete to continuous transformations
- Introduce the ODE formulation

**Mathematical Focus**:
- Spend time on the ODE: dz_t/dt = v(z_t, t)
- Explain what the vector field v represents intuitively
- Connect to physics analogies (particle flow, fluid dynamics)

**Teaching Tips**:
- Use visual analogies: "Think of particles flowing through space"
- Emphasize that v(z_t, t) tells us the direction and speed of flow at each point
- This is the key quantity we need to learn

### Slide 5: Flow Matching Core Concepts
**Duration**: 12 minutes
**Key Points**:
- Identify the central problem: training CNFs is expensive
- Introduce the Flow Matching solution
- Present the basic objective function

**Critical Insight**:
- Traditional CNF training requires solving ODEs during training
- Flow Matching avoids this by directly regressing vector fields
- This is the key innovation that makes the method practical

**Mathematical Discussion**:
- Walk through the loss function: L_FM(θ) = E[||v_t(x) - u_t(x)||²]
- Explain that u_t(x) is the "target" vector field we want to match
- The challenge: we don't know u_t(x) directly!

### Slide 6: Mathematical Framework - Three Key Theorems
**Duration**: 20 minutes
**Key Points**:
- These theorems are the theoretical foundation
- Each theorem solves a specific practical problem
- Don't get lost in proofs - focus on what each theorem enables

**Theorem 1 - Marginal Construction**:
- Problem: We need marginal vector fields but they're complex
- Solution: Use conditional vector fields instead
- Intuition: Easier to learn "how to get from A to B" than "how to get anywhere from anywhere"

**Theorem 2 - Loss Equivalence**:
- Problem: Are we actually solving the right problem?
- Solution: Yes! CFM loss has same gradients as FM loss
- Practical impact: We can use the simpler CFM formulation

**Theorem 3 - Gaussian Paths**:
- Problem: We still need to compute the conditional vector field
- Solution: For Gaussian paths, we have an explicit formula
- This makes the method actually implementable

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Focus on the intuition behind each theorem
- Emphasize the practical problem each one solves
- Save detailed proofs for advanced students or follow-up reading

### Slide 7: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM)
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Key Points**:
- This is where theory meets practice
- Walk through the training procedure step by step
- Emphasize the simplicity of the final algorithm

**Training Process Deep Dive**:
1. Sample time t and data point x₁
2. Sample from conditional path p_t(x|x₁)
3. Compute target vector field analytically
4. Train neural network to match this target

**Key Insight**:
- The target vector field u_t(x|x₁) can be computed in closed form
- No ODE solving needed during training!
- This is what makes Flow Matching practical

### Slide 8: Probability Paths & Vector Fields
**Duration**: 12 minutes
**Key Points**:
- Different paths lead to different training dynamics
- Connect to familiar concepts (DDPM is variance preserving)
- Optimal transport paths are fastest but may be harder to train

**Design Choices**:
- Variance Exploding: Good for exploration, may need more steps
- Variance Preserving: Well-studied, similar to diffusion models
- Optimal Transport: Theoretically optimal, straight-line paths

**Teaching Tips**:
- Use visual analogies: "Different ways to get from noise to data"
- Emphasize that this is a design choice with trade-offs
- Connect to students' intuition about shortest paths

### Slide 9: Training & Sampling Process
**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Key Points**:
- Contrast training (simple) vs sampling (requires ODE solving)
- Emphasize the key advantage: no simulation during training
- Sampling is where the computational cost is, but only at inference

**Practical Considerations**:
- Training: Just regression, very stable
- Sampling: Need good ODE solvers, but this is a solved problem
- Trade-off: Simple training for slightly more complex sampling

### Slide 10: Applications in Image Generation

## Common Student Misconceptions

### "Flow Matching is just another name for Normalizing Flows"
**Correction**: Flow Matching is a training method for Continuous Normalizing Flows. Traditional NFs use discrete transformations, while CNFs use continuous ODEs.

### "The vector field is learned end-to-end"
**Clarification**: The vector field network is trained to match analytically computed targets, not learned through backpropagation through ODE solving.

### "Flow Matching always uses straight-line paths"
**Correction**: Straight-line paths (optimal transport) are one option, but Flow Matching supports various probability path designs.

### "Flow Matching is always faster than diffusion models"
**Nuance**: Flow Matching can enable faster sampling due to straight-line paths, but the actual speed depends on implementation details and the number of function evaluations needed.
