## Overview

II Agent is built around providing an agentic interface to leading language models. It offers:

- A CLI interface for direct command-line interaction
- A WebSocket server that powers a modern React-based frontend
- Integration with multiple LLM providers:
  - Anthropic Claude models (direct API or via Google Cloud Vertex AI)
  - Google Gemini models (direct API or via Google Cloud Vertex AI)

## GAIA Benchmark Evaluation

II-Agent has been evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, which assesses LLM-based agents operating within realistic scenarios across multiple dimensions including multimodal processing, tool utilization, and web searching.

We identified several issues with the GAIA benchmark during our evaluation:

- **Annotation Errors**: Several incorrect annotations in the dataset (e.g., misinterpreting date ranges, calculation errors)
- **Outdated Information**: Some questions reference websites or content no longer accessible
- **Language Ambiguity**: Unclear phrasing leading to different interpretations of questions

Despite these challenges, II-Agent demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, particularly in areas requiring complex reasoning, tool use, and multi-step planning.

## Requirements

- Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- At least one of the following:
  - Anthropic API key, or
  - Google Gemini API key, or
  - Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled

> \[!TIP]
>
> - For best performance, we recommend using Claude 4.0 Sonnet or Claude Opus 4.0 models.
> - For fast and cheap, we recommend using GPT4.1 from OpenAI.
> - Gemini 2.5 Pro is a good balance between performance and cost.

## Installation

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the environment as mentioned in the above step
3. If you are using Anthropic Client run

```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```
Our II-Agent supports popular models such as Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI. If youâ€™d like to use a model from OpenRouter, simply configure your OpenAI endpoint with your OpenRouter API key.
If you are using Vertex, run with these variables

```
chmod +x start.sh
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=absolute-path-to-credential ./start.sh
```



(Optional) You can fill Google API credentials to connect to google drive. Press enter to skip these steps

### Runtime Environment

You can now select from a variety of models, set your API key, and configure environmentsâ€”all directly from the frontend settings pageâ€”to equip your agents with powerful tools and capabilities. You can also change the agents' runtime environment. Currently, we support three runtime modes: Local, Docker, and E2B. For full-stack web application development, Docker and E2B are highly recommended, while Local Mode is best suited for lighter tasks such as basic webpage building and research.

In addition, agents come equipped with built-in NeonDB and Vercel integration, enabling seamless cloud deployment of full-stack applications using a serverless database and serverless infrastructure.
